# Hand Sign Detection Using Mediapipe

# Aim of the Project
The main aim is to recognize and classify such hand gestures to their correct
meaning with the maximum accuracy possible.To detect initial hand locations, we designed a single-shot detector model optimized for mobile real-time uses in a manner similar to the face detection model in MediaPipe.

# Objective of the Project
The objective of the	is that dumb people use hand signs to communicate, hence normal people face problem in recognizing the words by signs made. So, there is a need of the systems which recognizes the different signs and conveys the information to the normal people.

# Scope of the Project
The scope of this project is to build a real time gesture classification system that can automatically detect gestures in natural lighting condition. In order to accomplish this objective, a real time gesture based system is developed to identify gestures. This system will work as one of futuristic of Machine learning and computer vision with user interface. Its create method to recognize hand gesture based on different parameters. The main priority of this system is to simple, easy and user friendly without making any special hardware. All computation will occur on single PC or workstation. Only special hardware will use to digitize the image (Digital Camera).

# Modules Used:

# Opencv
OpenCV is a Python open-source library, which is used for computer vision in Artificial intelligence, Machine Learning, face recognition, etc. It is a real-time Computer vision and image-processing framework built on C/C++. But weâ€™ll use it on python via the OpenCV-python package.

# Mediapipe
MediaPipe is a customizable machine learning solutions framework developed by Google. It is an open-source and cross-platform framework, and it is very lightweight. MediaPipe comes with some pre-trained ML solutions such as face detection, pose estimation, hand recognition, object detection, etc.

# Results
In this project I have used the hand sign detection logic through importing python libraries like Opencv and Mediapipe which will detect signs like FORWARD, BACKWARD, RIGHT, LEFT, STOP, LIKE and DISLIKE ..

# Conclusion
The Hand gesture recognition system has become an important role in building efficient human-machine interaction. Implementation using hand gesture recognition promises wide- ranging in technology industry. The MediaPipe as one framework based on machine learning plays an effective role in developing this application using hand gesture recognition, with the result has shown an accuracy performance of 95%. I would like to extend my system further to develop other hand signs and experiment with both static and dynamic hand gesture recognition systems.
